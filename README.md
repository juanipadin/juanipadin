<h2>Juan Ignacio Padin, Lawyer (Master in Corporate Law) and Developer </h2>
 
<p>I've specialize in IT Law my hole Lawyer carrer but since 2019, I've been working as a Developer. In spite of developing web sites since 2000 as a hobby, on 2019 that hobby became a job. When that happened, I started to study and use HTML and CSS to perform a better service to my clients.</p>
<p>The new interaction that my clients required, demand me to study and perform in programming. In order to perform a better and most reliable service, I study Python.</p>
<p>Python allow work with massive information (using SQL) and to perform AI to the data that my clients have as a Data Analyst. 
 
 <p> Always my career moved based on the needs of my clients. In this way, I began to apply JavaScript and React to the websites that I made. </p>
